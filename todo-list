=== Current todo ===

* SLdapModel API adjustments - findByFilter to be gone:
  * findByDn( dn, attributes )
  * findByUniqueAttribute( value, attributes )
  * findAll( filter, attributes, .... )

* people/index
  * Make the mail filter run over secondaryMail addresses as well
  * Display secondaryMail addresses as well as primary mail addresses perhaps? (should work in theory)
    
=== Notes ===
 
<toma> maybe languages might be handy
<bcooksley> good idea, we don't have that atm
<toma> phonenumbers?
<bcooksley> that is in contact details
<bcooksley> the second section
<toma> ah, there is a home phone
<bcooksley> yeah, I can rename that
<PovAddict> is there user-controlled access control for that?
<bcooksley> and probably should
<toma> maybe an emergency phone or more general 'emergency contact details'
<bcooksley> PovAddict: LDAP access controls and a little bit of Yii's own rbac will be doing that
<bcooksley> hm, good idea
<toma> and we need ev-details i guess?
<toma> and a picture :)
<PovAddict> bcooksley: I meant like "here's my phone number, but only other KDE devs can see it; here's the languages I speak, feel free to make this public"
<bcooksley> the ev-details stuff i'm still weighing up
<bcooksley> should it be a seperate page or shown on the same view page (obviously only ev-members would have that section)
<bcooksley> and for the avatar... I haven't decided if i'll embed it into the page
<bcooksley> or get it loaded from a url
<bcooksley> (embed = data: uri)
<toma> maybe just link it to that avatar site
<bcooksley> people are already allowed to upload avatars to the existing identity atm
<bcooksley> gravatar?
<toma> yeah, think s
<toma> o
<bcooksley> when I implement the avatar management functionality (as shown beside in the operations sidebar) then i'll probably implement the showing of the avatar on the view page
<toma> maybe some social media stuff, twitter, identi.ca, facebook ?
<bcooksley> duly thought of
<toma> or is that overkill ?
<bcooksley> hmm, could be, but I don't see too much of a problem
<PovAddict> the more info the better, as long as the user can keep it from being public :)
<toma> yeah
<bcooksley> fortunately now that we are using native LDAP access controls
<toma> maybe add a selection per field 'public, devs, ev-members, ev-board' ?
<PovAddict> we don't need Facebook's privacy panel
<PovAddict> but some control is needed
